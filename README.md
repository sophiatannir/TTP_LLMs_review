## Introduction

The presentation discusses the rapid advancements in natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, such as GPT-3, PaLM, ChatGPT, and Gemini. The purpose of the paper is to identify open problems and review applications and challenges related to LLMs.

## LLM Challenges

The paper groups challenges into three areas:
1. Design: decisions taken before deployment
2. Behavior: challenges that occur during deployment
3. Science: challenges that hinder academic progress

### Design Challenges

- Unfathomable Datasets
- Tokenizer Reliance
- High Pre-Training Costs

### Behavioral Challenges

- Prompt Brittleness
- Misaligned Behavior
- Outdated Knowledge

### Scientific Challenges

- Brittle Evaluations
- Reliance on Static Human Evaluations
- Lacking Experimental Designs

## Applications of LLMs

The PowerPoint presentation includes a section on the applications of LLMs.

## Code Demo

A code demo is available in the repository: [[Code Demo](https://github.com/sophiatannir/TTP_LLMs_review)]

## Critical Analysis

- What was overlooked by the authors?
- What could have been developed further?
- Were there any errors?
- Have others disputed the findings?

## Discussion and Q&A

The presentation includes a section for discussion and Q&A, with possible discussion questions.

## Citation

The citation for the paper will be included in this section.
